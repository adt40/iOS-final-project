# iOS-final-project

## TODO list:
* see if xCode "game" starting point is good for this project
  * Update: I think it'll be unnecessary to use the game starting point. It has a ton of extra stuff and I think we will have a much better time just using the black start and doing it from scratch.
* finalize game logic design
* write some backend code just to have it
* brainstorm game names

Use something like GenMyModel.com to see UML file if you care
